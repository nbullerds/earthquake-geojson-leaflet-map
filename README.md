# leaflet-challenge
Demonstration of skills in utilizing Leaflet with GeoJSON files.  The 17th challenge of the University of Minnesota's Data Analysis and Data Visualization Bootcamp.  

Leaflet-Step-2 displays the full functionality of the site, while Leaflet-Step-1 has the same functionality without as many map layer options and without the ability to turn on/off tectonic plate data.

In order to run this code, you will need to do the following before accessing the site:
1. Get a mapbox API key, which can be obtained here: https://www.mapbox.com/ 
2. Create a file called "config.js" in either Leaflet-Step-2/static/js or Leaflet-Step-1/static/js, depending on desired functionality.  If you are unsure which to use, default to the Leaflet-Step-2 folder.
3. In the config.js file, create a variable called "API_Key" and assign your mapbox API key to it.
